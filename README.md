# Shrink.me URL Shortener

Shrink.me is a full stack web application built with Node and Express that allows users to shorten long URLs (Ã  la bit.ly).

Shrink.me will also track how many times these links are clicked (including unique clicks). It will also save timestamps so that you can track when your links are most used.
